XMLParsable
==============

A Bunch of different XML Parser Implementations in Swift, using [```libxml```](http://xmlsoft.org) and conforming to a ```XMLParsableType``` interface. Helper functions provided, so that functions can be composed using Functional Programming techniques. A suite of performance and logic tests is provided for a fake ```Zoo``` model.

Isn't intended to be a complete or battle-tested implementation, just a companion to [some Articles on my Blog](http://lawrencelomax.github.io).

Uses the Open Source Projects: [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble), [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) & [Swiftz](http://github.com/maxpow4h/swiftz/)
